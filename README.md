Rails App Project

    This application is the result of Flat Iron School Phase 3 project 
    completion. This was part of a software engineering full-time course and was 
    built within the weeks 10-11 of the 20 week course. 

    In this Rails application, the idea is of inventory management. The user 
    gets to create an user account, create items, edit their own items,   
    and delete them as well. Create and edit their own profile as well.
    The application starts of by allowing the user to 
    create their own account within the Project Management System, or PMS.   
    They then will be able to do a couple of different things. 

    One, being that they will be able to see ALL items created by other 
    users. The intention, prior to running out of time, was to disallow the
    editing and deleting of items when they did not belong to the user. This 
    is not a function however at this time.

    Second, the user can create their own item by entering a name for the 
    item, and entering in the quantity and the unit of measurement. 
    Such as, 33 Cases of 9MM ACP. 

    Third, once a item has been created, the application will take them to 
    that specific items detail page where they can edit or delete the  
    project they just created, then re-save it again to the database. 

    and finally, as with any application, the user has the ability to log out of 
    their session by clicking the logout link. 

    As this is a web application, there are some styling to this as well. To 
    create the styling, I simply found a template  written in html that I  
    liked and utilized it throughout the application as I do not know much about 
    HTML or CSS, this was the fastest and easiest thing to do to give the  
    application a GU Interface. I did however figure out how to change the 
    coloring of some aspects, and did enjoy exploring that aspect of the  
    development. 

Running the application

    After cloning the repository to your text editor, run   
    bundle install, migrate the database and start the rails server.
    `bundle install`
    `rails db:migrate`
    `rails s`

    There you will be able to create a user name as well as items as 
    highlighted above. 

Versioning 1.0.0

    As this is a school project. Once the project has been submitted, no further 
    development will be completed. The version on this application is  stagnant.
